# neuroConn-BinaryFileSignal-Creator
The purpose of this simple application (created by neuroConn) is to convert a MATLAB file (*.mat) containing signal data to the neuroConn BinaryFileSignal-Format (*.bfs). The created file can be transferred to the panel-pc and then be used as a signal in the DC-Stimulator MC software.
